🌸 PCOS Care — Women’s Health Assistant

A friendly, end-to-end Women’s Health Assistant focused on PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome). This project combines a reproducible Random Forest risk model, a focused AI chatbot (Groq/OpenAI compatible), a period tracker, and a doctor contact directory — all wrapped in a clean, privacy-minded frontend and a lightweight FastAPI backend.

The aim: help people learn, triage, and prepare for conversations with healthcare providers — not to diagnose.

💡 Key Features

Predictive model
Reproducible Random Forest classifier (training script included)
Saves artifacts: model, encoders, scaler, feature names
Produces probability-based risk score and top contributing features

PCOS Expert Chatbot
Streamlit frontend + FastAPI backend integration
Backend can call Groq/OpenAI LLMs with a strict PCOS-only system prompt
Retrieval-first layer using curated FAQ for deterministic answers when possible
Returns structured response: assistant text, sources, confidence

Utilities
Period Tracker (browser storage)
Doctor Directory (click-to-call/email)
UI-first Streamlit app for prediction, charts, and chatbot

Developer-friendly
Modular frontend/backend separation
Docker-ready, simple deployment instructions
README, sample requests, and example backend for Groq included

🏗 Architecture (high level)
Frontend: Streamlit app (UI for prediction, chatbot, tracker, directory)
Backend: FastAPI
/chat -> handles chatbot requests, retrieves FAQ context, calls LLM
/predict -> loads model artifacts and returns risk probability + top features
Model artifacts: stored under models/ (joblib)
Local data: data.csv (training / sample records)
Optional: Docker containers for frontend/backend

🚀 Quickstart (developer)
Prereqs: Python 3.9+, git, (optional) Docker.

Clone
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo>

Create a virtualenv and install requirements
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS / Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt

Environment variables
For LLM (Groq) integration set:
GROQ_API_KEY=sk-...
Example (Linux/macOS):
export GROQ_API_KEY="sk-..."
Windows PowerShell:
$env:GROQ_API_KEY="sk-..."

▶️ Run the backend (FastAPI)
Start the backend that serves both chat and prediction endpoints:
uvicorn pcos_backend_improved:app --reload --port 8000

Endpoints:

POST /chat — accepts {"messages": [...]} (OpenAI-style). Returns:
{ "assistant": "...", "sources": [...], "confidence": 0.85 }
POST /predict — accepts user features JSON (see example below). Returns:
{ "probability": 0.42, "risk_pct": 42.0, "top_features": [{"feature":"BMI","value":...}], "explanation": "..." }
Example /chat request:

{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "Optional system prompt"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What are common PCOS symptoms?"}
  ]
}
Example /predict request:

{
  "features": {
    "Age": 27,
    "Height(cm)": 162,
    "Weight(kg)": 62,
    "BMI": 23.6,
    "Cycle Length(days)": 35,
    ...
  }
}

▶️ Run the frontend (Streamlit)
Start the Streamlit app (UI: chatbot, prediction form, tracker, doctors):

streamlit run app.py
The app expects the backend at http://localhost:8000 by default. You can change endpoints in the Streamlit config/constants.
🧪 Training & Model artifacts
Training script: train_pcos_realdata.py
Loads data.csv, preprocesses, trains RandomForestClassifier, evaluates, saves artifacts under models/ using joblib.
Recommended improvements for production:
Use StratifiedKFold cross-validation
Calibrate probabilities (CalibratedClassifierCV)
Hyperparameter tuning (RandomizedSearchCV / Optuna)
External validation on real clinical data
After training you should have:
models/model.pkl
models/encoders.pkl
models/scaler.pkl
models/feature_names.pkl
The backend will load these artifacts and expose /predict.

📚 Curated FAQ & Retrieval
The backend includes a small curated FAQ (JSON/embedded list). When user queries closely match FAQ entries, the service returns short deterministic answers. Otherwise it appends FAQ snippets to the LLM prompt to ground responses.

Add vetted references to FAQ_ITEMS (in pcos_backend_improved.py) to improve correctness and traceability.

🔒 Privacy & Disclaimer
This project is educational and supportive; it is NOT a medical diagnostic tool.
Do not store personally identifiable information (PII) in logs.
Display a clear disclaimer in the UI: recommend users consult a clinician for diagnosis or urgent concerns.
Suggested UI disclaimer:

🐳 Docker (optional)
Example Dockerfiles are provided for frontend/backend. Basic commands:

# build backend
docker build -t pcos-backend -f Dockerfile.backend .
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e GROQ_API_KEY="sk-..." pcos-backend

# build frontend
docker build -t pcos-frontend -f Dockerfile.frontend .
docker run -p 8501:8501 pcos-frontend
Adjust CORS and allowed hosts for production.

✅ Testing & Validation
Unit tests: model loading, /predict schema, /chat request handling.
Manual validation: compare predicted probabilities with known cases or clinician feedback.
Monitor drift and set alerts if the prediction distribution changes.
